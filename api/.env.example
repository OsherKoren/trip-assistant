# Environment Configuration for Trip Assistant API
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
# IMPORTANT: Never commit .env to version control!

# --- Environment Mode ---
# Controls whether API imports local agent or uses Lambda proxy
# Options: "dev" (local agent) or "prod" (Lambda proxy)
ENVIRONMENT=dev

# --- OpenAI API Key ---
# Required for local agent invocation (dev mode only)
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# --- AWS Configuration (Production Mode Only) ---
# These are only needed when ENVIRONMENT=prod

# AWS region where agent Lambda is deployed
AWS_REGION=us-east-2

# Name of the agent Lambda function
# Example: trip-assistant-agent-prod
AGENT_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME=

# AWS credentials (handled by Lambda execution role in production)
# For local SAM CLI testing, use AWS CLI configuration or:
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=

# --- Local Development Notes ---
# 1. Set ENVIRONMENT=dev for local development with FastAPI dev server
# 2. Agent must be installed: cd ../agent && uv pip install -e .
# 3. Run with: fastapi dev app/main.py
# 4. Access at: http://localhost:8000/api/

# --- SAM CLI Testing Notes ---
# 1. SAM CLI uses .env file automatically (configured in samconfig.toml)
# 2. Set ENVIRONMENT=dev to test with local agent
# 3. Set ENVIRONMENT=prod to test Lambda proxy (requires agent Lambda deployed)
# 4. Run with: sam local start-api

# --- Production Lambda Notes ---
# 1. Set ENVIRONMENT=prod
# 2. OPENAI_API_KEY not needed (agent Lambda handles OpenAI calls)
# 3. AWS credentials provided by Lambda execution role
# 4. AGENT_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME must match deployed agent function
